        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jaden Gan. I was born December 31, 2001 and Iâ€™m currently a Political Science major. I have lots of prior experience into why I chose Political Science as my major. I started participating in youth and government programs in middle school. I was part of a program called Model UN and I absolutely enjoyed it. I learned many basic skills when interacting with peers and took the leadership role many times in the groups I was in. I learned to not be shy and how to talk about sensitive topics appropriately. I also learned how to collaborate with others in order to come up with a solution to an issue. I made many friends in my experience there. Also in high school I participated in Youth and Government, which was a more serious setting since we participated in activities that reflected the real world and we would actually visit the capitol building in California. We did exact models of bill processing and real court cases. I had a lot of fun participating in these events. I learned how to speak on the spot and grab ideas and flaws in others' presentations. I learned to be firm with my beliefs but also be considerate and understand others opinions as well.<br><br>

         I also participated in my school's ASB and made many friends through that. I was vice president for 2 years and many times I had to step up into the leadership role to take over the class. I learned that people need an incentive if I ask them to do something and that there always has to be an award. I played volleyball in high school and was actually the captain of the team. I was younger on the team at the time as well so I learned how to deal with people older than me. I was respectful but also commanding at the same time. I also played many other sports throughout life. In middle school I also was honored all the time. I also live on the moon and invented tesla. I wanted to be super rich so I can solve everyone's issues since money is the key to everything. After joining political science I learned many interesting things but my classes have been very boring. I want to find the ultimate compromise to everyone's issues since people can never agree on anything. <br><br>

         People only think that they are right and that they are always right especially when it comes to government related issues. Itâ€™s very interesting how people think like this. I also wish I didnâ€™t have to take my mandatory chfy class. Itâ€™s basically a useless class, some of the information is useful but the rest of the class is me just sitting there doing nothing. Covid has affected everyone so now everyone is extremely lazy. I want to travel around the world as well, I want to visit other places to learn how their government works. I want to learn what governments succeed and what doesnâ€™t work. I want to see what government pleases the most people.
